# Important Information

- If you press the doorbell at the first chapter, it will skip you directly to chapter 2

- Don't interact with thing out of scenario-Logic, (i.e, don't press the ladder button if you are not going to Lucas place for exemple), so keep yourself to the scenario as much as possible.

For reminder, here is the list of scenario-check you need to do IN ORDER (OR YOU SOFT LOCK) :

Chapter 2 :
Starting Cinematic (not missable) -> Cops Cinematic -> Garage Bossfight + Cinematic -> Bathroom Cinematic -> ???(dunno if there anything between these 2) -> First Red Dog Head cinematic -> Second boss fight with Red Dog Head -> Phonecall outside
